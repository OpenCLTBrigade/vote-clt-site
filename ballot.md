There are several online resources you can use to preview an election ballot specific to your location as well as perform research on candidates that are running.

If you are already registered to vote, you can preview your ballots through the <a href="https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">North Carolina State Board of Elections Voter Search Tool</a>. To do this, enter your information on the search form <a href="https://vt.ncsbe.gov/RegLkup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, click "search", then click your name on the list of the results. On the following page you should see a "sample ballots" section that links to ballots for the "11/15/2019 GENERAL" election, the way they might appear on the voting machine at your polling place.

To do a little more research you can use the assistance of sites like <a href="https://www.vote411.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vote411</a>, <a href="https://www.ballotready.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BallotReady</a>, and <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ballotpedia</a>. These are "voter guides" assembled by organizations that have their teams do research and aggregate information for you. 

You can also get started quickly by entering your address in the form below and clicking "get started." The form will take you straight to <a href="https://www.ballotready.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BallotReady</a>'s voting guide for your address.
